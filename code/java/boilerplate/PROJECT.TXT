PROJECTS
========

boilerplate           runtime dependency
boilerplateBuild      Ant build files
boilerplateProcessor  compile-time class processor
boilerplateTest       unit tests


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

When initially loaded in Eclipse, compilation will fail because the ASM and
JUnit dependencies are missing. Running the build.xml Ant build script should
download them to the appropriate location if they are not present
(see build_deps.xml for details).

Running build.xml generates two jar files:

boilerplateBuild/build/bin/boilerplate.jar   runtime classes

boilerplateBuild/build/bin/bpc.jar           class processor tool
                                             (depends on:
                                               boilerplate.jar
                                               asm-all-3.1.jar)


GETTING STARTED
===============

Create a file AutoEqualsImpl.java:

 @AutoEquals
 public class AutoEqualsImpl {
     public String foo = "Hello, World!";
 }

Compile the class:

 javac -cp boilerplate.jar AutoEqualsImpl.java

Process the compiled class directory:

 java -jar bpc.jar .

Verify that the equals and hashCode methods have been added
with the Sun JDK 6 disassembler:

 javap -classpath . AutoEqualsImpl


CRUDE ECLIPSE INTEGRATION
=========================

Add an Ant builder in the project properties.
See "boilerplateTest/builder_build.xml" for sample code.
